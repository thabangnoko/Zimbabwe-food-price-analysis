Here I undertook a data analysis project of Zimbabwe using data from Global food prices to identify any trends in the food prices in Zimbabwe, i.e, what food is cheapest/most expensive.

#  Dataset
The original dataset was too large to upload to the repository but it can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices
