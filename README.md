# Zimbabwe-food-price-analysis
Here I undertook a data exploration/analysis project of Zimbabwe food prices. The data investigated was from Global food prices and it was used to identify any trends in the food prices in Zimbabwe, i.e, what food is cheapest/most expensive. Data on GDP was also obtained to compare how this may have correlated to the food prices.

#  Questions investigated
-  What food is produced most each year
-  How have food prices changed over the years
-  What city are food prices the highest/lowest
-  What food is most/least expensive
- Is there any relationship between change in GDP and change in food prices

#  Dataset
-  The original dataset was too large to upload to the repository but it can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices
-  The next data set was Zimbabwe GDP Per capita 1960-2023 which can be found at https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ZWE/zimbabwe/gdp-per-capita
