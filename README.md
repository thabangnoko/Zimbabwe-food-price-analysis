# Zimbabwe-food-price-analysis
Here I undertook a data analysis project of Zimbabwe using data from Global food prices to identify any trends in the food prices in Zimbabwe, i.e, what food is cheapest/most expensive. Data on GDP was also obtained to compare how this may have behaved compared to the food prices.

#  Dataset
-The original dataset was too large to upload to the repository but it can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices
-The next data set was Zimbabwe GDP Per capita 1960-2023 which can be found at https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ZWE/zimbabwe/gdp-per-capita
